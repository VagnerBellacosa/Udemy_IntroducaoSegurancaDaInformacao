### [Dedicated to all the hackers - Pho3nix (Roulette Cinese)](http://www.zone-h.com/news/id/4746)

24/03/2014 Written by Roberto SyS64738 Preatoni



We finally con­cluded the Hacker Visual Con­test through which we col­lected video­clips and art­work from the hacker world which we used to assem­ble the offi­cial video­clip for the song “Pho3nix” (Roulette Cinese) ded­i­cated to the hacker world.
I feel obliged to thank all of the par­tic­i­pants, cred­its are added at the end of the clip with a spe­cial men­tion to Chris­tan Milani for the out­stand­ing remix, to Roberto “SyS64738” Preatoni for pro­mot­ing the idea through­out the hacker world and to Gian­luca Zenone aka Alex Dreiser for the video­clip real­iza­tion.
Thanks again to all of you and… enjoy the clip.

Joe Raggi (Roulette Cinese)

### [The Virtual Graffiti Project](http://www.zone-h.com/news/id/4745)

To the Zone-H community:

I’m a spe­cial­ist in graf­fiti, one of the old­est and most inter­est­ing forms of human expression.

As a researcher at a major North Amer­i­can Uni­ver­sity, I’ve been care­fully fol­low­ing the most recent devel­op­ment in the long his­tory of graf­fiti: the move to the dig­i­tal envi­ron­ment and the rise of what I call *Vir­tual Graf­fiti* – my name for the work you do and for what is pre­served here at Zone-H.

I’m inter­view­ing vir­tual graf­fiti artists as part of *The Vir­tual Graf­fiti Project*, an exhi­bi­tion that I’m putting together with some friends and col­leagues, to intro­duce vir­tual graf­fiti to the broader world. I work on Skype or Gmail chat, and record inter­views on a dig­i­tal recorder, care­fully pro­tect­ing the anonymity of my sources (see below).

### [Call for hacker visual artwork](http://www.zone-h.com/news/id/4744)

Know­ing me both as a musi­cian and a rep­re­sen­ta­tive of the hack­ing world, I have been play­ing as a guest in a music track for an ital­ian electro-pop group (Roulette Cinese).
The track name is Pho3nix and the lyrics talk about hack­ers and the hacker’s world.
The group leader now would like to make a video­clip for such track and the movie maker would like to receive images, draw­ings, pic­tures, movies any sort of visu­ally artis­tic thing done by hack­ers while lis­ten­ing to this audio track and think­ing about what the con­cept of hacking/​hacker visu­ally rep­re­sents to them.
To help Roulette Cinese to col­lect visual mate­r­ial for the video­clip I am now run­ning around ask­ing to hack­ers to lis­ten to this track
https://​sound​cloud​.com/​e​r​r​e​-​p​i​/​r​o​u​l​e​t​t​e​-​c​i​n​e​s​e​-​p​h​o​e​n​i​x-rmx
and if inter­ested to par­tic­i­pate, to send me a visual art­work for what hack­ing means to them.
It could be rep­re­sent­ing any sub­ject, in whichever style, it’s totally up to every sin­gle par­tic­i­pant as long as it related to hack­ing.
The pictures/​artworks can be signed with your name or nick­name.
Would you be up to help me and Roulette Cinese by:

– par­tic­i­pat­ing and send­ing me one visual art­work from your side
– help­ing me to dif­fuse this ask­ing also to other hack­ers friend of yours to participate?


You can send your visual art­work to admin@​zone-​h.​org, email sub­ject: Pho3nix

Thanks a lot for your help!

### [Hacker diagnosed with brain cancer, hacks the closed source report distributing it to the open source community hoping to get some help](http://www.zone-h.com/news/id/4743)

09/09/2012 Written by SyS64738



This is a some­what aston­ish­ing news, and once again the demon­stra­tion that alter­na­tive think­ing might be the way to solve appar­ently unsolv­able cases.
I just report what was writ­ten by the hacker him­self on his web­site.
Can any­one help?



*Rome, Sep­tem­ber 10th 2012*

**I have a brain can­cer.**

Yes­ter­day I went to get my dig­i­tal med­ical records: *I have to show them to many doc­tors*.

**Sadly they were in a closed, pro­pri­etary for­mat** and, thus, I could not open them using my com­puter, or send them in this for­mat to all the peo­ple who could have saved my life.

**I cracked them**.

I opened them and con­verted the con­tents into open for­mats, so that I could **share them with every­one**.

Just today I have been able to share the data about my health con­di­tion (about my brain can­cer) with 3 doc­tors.

**2 of them already replied**.

I have been able to do it because the data used **open, acces­si­ble for­mats**: they have been able to open the files using their com­put­ers, their tablets. They have been able to reply from home, on sun­day.

I will pro­gres­sively pub­lish all the replies I will receive, using open for­mats, so that any­one with my same dis­ease will be able to ben­e­fit from the solu­tions I will find.

**This is a CURE. This is my OPEN SOURCE CURE**.

*This is an open invi­ta­tion to take part in the CURE.*

**CURE, in dif­fer­ent cul­tures, means dif­fer­ent things.**

There are cures for the body, for spirit, for com­mu­ni­ca­tion.

**Grab the infor­ma­tion about my dis­ease, if you want, and give me a CURE**: cre­ate a video, an art­work, a map, a text, a poem, a game, or try to find a solu­tion for my health prob­lem.

Artists, design­ers, hack­ers, sci­en­tists, doc­tors, pho­tog­ra­phers, video­mak­ers, musi­cians, writ­ers. **Any­one can give me a CURE**.

Cre­ate your CURE using the con­tent which you find in the ***DATI/DATA*** sec­tion here on this site, and send it to [**info@artisopensource.net**](mailto:info@artisopensource.net).

**ZONE-H.ORG: IF IT MIGHT HAP­PEN THAT YOU KNOW ANY DOC­TOR WILL­ING TO CON­SIDER THE CASE, PLEASE CON­SIDER TO SUB­MIT THIS CASE** **TO HIM** **.

THANKS A LOT, Roberto “SyS64738” Preatoni**

### [Zone-H celebrates its 10 years!](http://www.zone-h.com/news/id/4742)

09/03/2012 Written by Kevin Fernandez (Siegfried)



![img](http://www.zone-h.com/files/images/2012/10-years-birthday-cake.jpg)10 years ago Zone-H opened, a lit­tle web­site with secu­rity news and a “cyber­crime archive” which quickly became suc­cess story. The goals of Zone-H were to fol­low secu­rity trends and ana­lyze the grow­ing impor­tance of hacktivism.

It was born in Esto­nia on march 2, 2002 and started to save deface­ments on march 9, one week later.
